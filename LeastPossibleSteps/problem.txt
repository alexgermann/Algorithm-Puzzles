Developers, 

Below is the latest Hacker Challenge problem. There’s one small wrinkle in todays Hacker Challenge. You must use Rust (https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust) when coding up your solution. A quick setup guide for Rust in VS Code can be found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-setup-rust-in-vscode/. 

Hacker Problem: 

Given a positive integer N, find the smallest number of steps it will take to reach 1.
There are two kinds of permitted steps:
•             You may decrement N to N - 1.
•             If a * b = N, you may decrement N to the larger of a and b.
For example, given 100, you can reach 1 in five steps with the following route: 100 -> 10 -> 9 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1.

As always cocktails are optional during the Hacker Challenge. 

Happy Coding!
